- This page will be highlighting my plans for every day of the week to ensure that I am prepared for the AP exam. 

# Monday
- Today, I brainstormed the plan to follow for the rest of the week. This includes the resources I will use and how I will spend my classtime and time at home
- I have started reading the Barron's AP Review book over spring break and will continue to do so, completing the Unit problems as I go.

# Tuesday
- In class, I will be taking a practice MC that spans all the units
- At home, I will read up to Unit 6 in the prep book and complete a practice exam

# Wednesday
- In class, I will review the missed questions on Tuesday's MC and go over concepts I struggled with
- At home, I will try practicing with some FRQs. I will use pencil and paper to get accustomed to the exam format, and look at the Barron's book as well as AP Classroom for sample FRQs

# Thursday
- In class, 

# Friday
-

# Resources and Ideas
- Try writing all of the different sorts and data structures by myself
- Barron's AP Review Book- read over summaries, unit problems, practice tests
- AP Classroom: progress checks, sample tests, and concept videos
- Journals from earlier trimesters: these contain my notes for all of the College Board topics
- I can also go to College Board's website to find past examinations
