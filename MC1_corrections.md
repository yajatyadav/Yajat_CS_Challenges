- I got this question wrong because I made a careless mistake and did not realize that the public class Athlete did not implement the Student interface
- Thus, Athlete can't be used to construct a Student object

- For this problem, I made a random guess because I was starting to run out of time
- For each row-col, the board first initialized to "O"

- then for val = 3, for all columns and
